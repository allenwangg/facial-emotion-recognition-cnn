## Facial Emotion Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks
#### Dzung Pham

#### Final project for CS 373 Artificial Intelligence - Williams College

Predict facial emotions expressed in real-time with your webcam. The 7 emotions are: angry, disgust, sad, happy, fearful, surprise, neutral.

Test accuracy: 65.33%. Validation accuracy: 64.25%

#### Sample images:

![Figure 1: 3 people. The 2 people on the right make fairly clear and discernible emotions, while the person on the left makes fairly ambiguous emotion (smirk? happily smirking?)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vietdzung/facial_emotion_recognition_cnn/master/demo/img1.png)

![Figure 2: A large group of people. The OpenCV face detector makes some mistakes. Note the skull.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vietdzung/facial_emotion_recognition_cnn/master/demo/img2.jpg)
